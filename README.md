# 🤖 Smart AI-IoT Based Fall Detection & Health Monitoring System for Elderly

📌 Overview
---
The Smart AI – IoT Based Fall Detection and Health Monitoring System is an IoT-enabled solution that integrates Artificial Intelligence and sensor technologies to ensure the safety and health of elderly individuals. The system continuously monitors vital signs (heart rate, SpO₂, body temperature) and detects falls using AI-driven algorithms. Real-time data is uploaded to the ThingSpeak cloud platform and alerts are sent to caregivers via a web/mobile interface for immediate intervention.

This project promotes safer, healthier, and independent living for elderly individuals by combining IoT, AI, and cloud-based analytics.
