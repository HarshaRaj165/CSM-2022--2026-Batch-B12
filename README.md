# ðŸ¤– Smart AI-IoT Based Fall Detection & Health Monitoring System for Elderly

ðŸ“Œ Overview
---
The Smart AI â€“ IoT Based Fall Detection and Health Monitoring System is an IoT-enabled solution that integrates Artificial Intelligence and sensor technologies to ensure the safety and health of elderly individuals. The system continuously monitors vital signs (heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, body temperature) and detects falls using AI-driven algorithms. Real-time data is uploaded to the ThingSpeak cloud platform and alerts are sent to caregivers via a web/mobile interface for immediate intervention.

This project promotes safer, healthier, and independent living for elderly individuals by combining IoT, AI, and cloud-based analytics.
